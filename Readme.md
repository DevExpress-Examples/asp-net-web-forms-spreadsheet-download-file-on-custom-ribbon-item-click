# Spreadsheet for ASP.NET Web Forms - How to download a document on a custom ribbon item click

This example illustrates how to download a file on a custom ribbon item click.

## Overview

The item is added in code behind toÂ the existing ribbon tabs. The tabs are generated by the [ASPxSpreadsheet.CreateDefaultRibbonTabs](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxSpreadsheet.ASPxSpreadsheet.CreateDefaultRibbonTabs(System.Boolean))Â method:

```cs
  Spreadsheet.CreateDefaultRibbonTabs(true);
  RibbonButtonItem item = new RibbonButtonItem("Download", "Download");
  Spreadsheet.RibbonTabs[1].Groups[0].Items.Insert(0, item);
```

Since it is not possible to download a document on a callback request,Â a ribbon item shouldÂ send a postback. For this, use theÂ [__doPostBack](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/667531/doPostBack-function) function in the client-sideÂ [ASPxClientSpreadsheet.CustomCommandExecuted](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/js-ASPxClientSpreadsheet.CustomCommandExecuted) event handler:

```js
function onCustomCommandExecuted(s,e) {
  if (e.commandName == "Download") 
      __doPostBack("DownloadExcel");
  }
```

ASPxSpreadsheet in this example loads data from a database, so the default file dialogs are disabled.

Note that a cell doesn't get the value an end-user entered until the user clicks Enter or tabs out of this cell. As a result the issue with saving an entered value may occur if the value was not submitted. To force submission of the last entered value, call the [ASPxClientSpreadsheet.ApplyCellEdit](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/js-ASPxClientSpreadsheet.ApplyCellEdit) method.
